This deals with the BATADAL dataset published in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minhbtnguyen/batadal-a-dataset-for-cyber-attack-detection/
There are 43 columns and a 1/0 label column, with 1 meaning that the system is under attack and 0 meaning that the system is in normal operation.
Training Dataset 1: This dataset was released on November 20 2016, and it was generated from a one-year long simulation. The dataset does not contain any attacks, i.e. all the data pertains to C-Town normal operations.
Training Dataset 2: This dataset with partially labeled data was released on November 28 2016. The dataset is around 6 months long and contains several attacks, some of which are approximately labeled.
Test Dataset: This 3-months long dataset contains several attacks but no labels. The dataset was released on February 20 2017, and it is used to compare the performance of the algorithms.
